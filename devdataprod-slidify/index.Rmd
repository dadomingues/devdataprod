## The Project

This is my reproducible pitch presentation, where I describe what I did in my
simple app project.

This project just works with "mtcars" dataset and makes the linear regression
of two variables which the user choose the predictor and the the outcome is
always the "mpg".

Take this amazing experience going to
<http://dadomingues.shinyapps.io/devdataprod-cp>.

## The Dataset column names

```{r}
names(mtcars)
```

## How it works

- The user select the predictor (x)
- The user select a color to the regression line
- In both cases above, when the user make a choice, the plot is updated.

## Plot Sample

```{r, echo=FALSE}
    with(mtcars, {
        plot(mpg ~ cyl,xlab="cyl",ylab="mpg")
        abline(lm(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars),col=2)
    })
```
